## Least square regression line

Regression line is the straight line which best describes the relationship between 2 variables
$X$ and $Y$. Formally

$$
Y = a+bX
$$

### Find the value of $b$

The value of $b$ can be calculated using either of the following:

$$
\begin{align*}
b &= \rho(X,Y) \frac{\sigma_Y}{\sigma_X} \\
b &= \frac{n\sum_{i=1}^n(x_iy_i) - \sum_{i=1}^n(x_i)\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i)}{n\sum_{i=1}^n(x^2_i) - (\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i))^2}
\end{align*}
$$

### Find the value of $a$

$$
a = \bar{y} - b\bar{x}
$$

Where $\bar{x}$ and $\bar{y}$ is the mean of $X$ and $Y$ respectively
