In the book [Rules for a Knight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_for_a_Knight), Ryan Hawke
states 20 life lessons Sir Thomas wished to pass along to his decendants.

The book serves as a blueprint of civilized growth and self-improvement. I hope these lessons
benefit you as much as it does to me.

## 20 rules for a Knight

### 1. Solitude

Create time alone with yourself. When seeking the wisdom and clarity of your own mind, silence is a helpful tool.

### 2. Humility

Never announce that you are a knight, simply behave as one. You are better than no one, and no one is better than you.

### 3. Gratitude

The only intelligent response to the ongoing gift of life is gratitude.
For all that has been, a knight says, “Thank you.” For all that is to come, a knight says, “Yes!”

### 4. Pride

Never pretend you are not a knight or attempt to diminish yourself because you deem it will make others more comfortable.
We show others the most respect by offering the best of ourselves.

### 5. Cooperation

Each one of us is walking our own road. We are born at specific times, in specific places, and our challenges are unique.
As knights, understanding and respecting our distinctiveness is vital to our ability to harness our collective strength.

### 6. Friendship

The quality of your life will, to a large extent, be decided by with whom you elect to spend your time.

### 7. Forgiveness

Those who cannot easily forgive will not collect many friends. Look for the best in others.

### 8. Honesty

A dishonest tongue and a dishonest mind waste time, and therefore waste our lives.

### 9. Courage

Anything that gives light must endure burning.

### 10. Grace

Grace is the ability to accept change. Be open and supple; the brittle break.

### 11. Patience

A hurried mind is an addled mind; it cannot see clearly or hear precisely.
A knight makes time his ally. There is a moment for action, and with a clear mind that moment is obvious.

### 12. Justice

There is only one thing for which a knight has no patience: injustice. Every true knight fights for human dignity at all times.

### 13. Generosity

You were born owning nothing and with nothing you will pass out of this life. Be frugal and you can be generous.

### 14. Discipline

In the field of battle, as in all things, you will perform as you practice.
Excellence lives in attention to detail.
The better a knight prepares, the less willing he will be to surrender.

### 15. Dedication

Ordinary effort, ordinary result.

### 16. Speech

Do not speak ill of others. A knight does not spread news that he does not know to be certain, or condemn things that he does not understand.

### 17. Faith

Sometimes to understand more, you need to know less.

### 18. Equality

Every knight holds human equality as an unwavering truth.
A knight is never present when men or women are being degraded or compromised in any way,
because if a knight were present, those committing the hurtful acts or words would be made to stop.

### 19. Love

Love is the end goal. It is the music of our lives. There is no obstacle that enough love cannot move.

### 20. Death

Life is a long series of farewells; only the circumstances should surprise us.
A knight concerns himself with gratitude for the life he has been given.
He does not fear death, for the work one knight begins, others may finish.
