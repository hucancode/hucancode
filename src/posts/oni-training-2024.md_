First of all, happy new year to all who celebrate, wish you happiness and prosperity in the year ahead. I hope the luck be with you and your family. May God of The Dragon üê≤ gives you strength to overcome all the hardships that might cross your path.

## Last Year's Achievement

Before go to the goal for this year, I would like to mention my last year‚Äôs achievements. I have grown and I‚Äôm proud of it.

### Programming

Last year I picked up `rust ü¶Ä` and like it very much. I can say that was a successful attempt. `kotlin` is also on my list but other than knowing its syntax I haven't done anything significant.

### Blog & Internet Presence

I have managed to maintain a blog, mostly low-effort leetcode solution but it's an active blog nonetheless.
I have also did some creative coding and get something interesting out of it.

### Nhi

This year is definitely incomplete without Nhi. After went through some moments of awkard silent, countless of silly conversations and finished with a clumsy confession. I did it. We are officially together, since 15<super>th</super> July 2023. We have walked through temple in Kyoto together. I have seen panda in real life for the first time, and her too probably. We may seem incompatible sometimes but turned out we are surprisingly compatible. Turned out I still love her even when she refuse to kiss. And no sex after 5 months of dating looks like a red-flag to many, but not to us. Until today I am still learning to love her and I like that.

### 10000 steps

I have been maintaining 10k steps nearly everyday since earlier this year. I even installed Strava and kept running for a month. Not so impressive but still an achievement.

## New Year's Resolution üéâ

### Methodology

I will refer to [the Infinity Stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_Stones) üíé as an abstraction of multiple aspects in life. Word on the street is that, to be as powerful as `Thanos`, one must find himself not 1, not 2, but 6 Infinity Stones. Since I am on my quest seeking the ultimate power, this year I want to improve my:

#### ‚ö° Power Stone

Power (or strength) is one of the most primitive quality a person can have. Having abundant strength helps increase longevity and life quality. Training Taiji is a good way to address that problem. Specifically I will train:

- Core strength, hip strength, leg strength
- Stamina
- Flexibility

#### üêæ Space Stone

I would like to be organized, specifically:

- Maintain clean room, messy room messy mind
- Maintain clean body and clean looks

#### üß† Mind Stone

Knowledge is power, knowledge is also money. I am pretty confident with the calculation and logical thinking. But there are still some domains remain foreign to me. I would like to explore those next year:

- Train Leetcode
- Learn about the body, live longer
- Finance

#### üíñ Soul Stone

Next year I would like to:

- Be more romantic
- Take better care of my family member

#### ‚ú® Reality Stone

Reality means fate in our culture. It takes great effort to go against the heaven and change my fate. One can easily know that making such changes in 1 year is difficult. So this year I will narrow down my target to:

- Learn System Design
- If at all possible, I would like to work on the game I always wanted to
- If at all possible, learn to animate 3D characters
- If at all possible, lean math, geometry, combinatorics

#### ‚è∞ Time Stone

I do not have a sense of time management. This year I would like to:

- Learn to set time and scope of work to all tasks
- Get up early consistently

### To Wrap This Up, This Year I Resolve To ...
