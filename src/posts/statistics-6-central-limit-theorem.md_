## Central limit theorem

The central limit theorem (CLT) establishes that, in many situations,
for identically distributed independent samples, the standardized sample mean
tends towards the standard normal distribution
even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed.

Eventhough at first our data seems to be chaotic (1), skew to the right (2) or left (3).
We can safely say that when sample size is big enough, most probability distributions
will eventually becomes normal distribution.
