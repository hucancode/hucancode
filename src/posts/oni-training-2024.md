Xin ch√†o, hello, „Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ, ‰Ω†Â•Ω it's me again, happy new year to all who celebrates, wish you happiness and prosperity in the year ahead. I hope the luck be with you and your relatives. I wish you not the easy life but the power to make your life easy. May the God of The Dragon üê≤ gives you strength to overcome all the hardships that might cross your path.

## Last Year's Achievement

Before go to the goals for this year, I would like to mention some nice thing happened last year. I have done some good job and I would like to praise myself for it.

### Reading

I have read 12 books this year. Taking out boring technical books, there are 9 about psychology, dating, self-help, business. Thinking in Bets, Atomic Habits, How to Not Die Alone is some that worth mentioning. I have broaden my knowledge and I like me that way.

### Programming

Last year I picked up `rust ü¶Ä` and like it very much. I can confidently say I am now a Rustacean. That was a successful attempt or at least a nice adventure I would say. On a side note, `kotlin` is also on my list but I haven't done anything significant with it. Last but not least, my `C++` skill got certificated by [CPP Institute](https://verify.openedg.org/?id=8iHK.Ohf3.ZMBn)

### Internet Presence

My personal toy web page is up to date with modern looks and cool stuffs, pretty proud of it. I also have managed to maintain a blog, mostly low-effort leetcode solutions but it's an active blog nonetheless. I have also did some creative coding and got something interesting out of it.

### Nhi üíñ

The relationship with Nhi is, without a doubt the best thing happened last year. After not a few moments of awkard silent, countless silly conversations and a clumsy confession, I did it. We are officially together, since 15<super>th</super> July 2023. We have walked through temples in Kyoto together. I have seen panda in real life for the first time, and her too probably. Speaking of panda, we have seen panda in most places we can find them in Japan. It's crazy how an introvert who never go outside like me now enjoy wandering Tokyo's street. Our personalities may seems contrast but turned out that's what makes us compatible. Fights make us understand each other more. I still learning to love her until today and I enjoy that process.

### 10K steps

I have been maintaining 10K steps nearly everyday since earlier this year. I even installed Strava and kept running for a month. Not so impressive but still an achievement.

## New Year's Resolution üéâ

### Methodology

Continue the tradition I have established last year. I will use [the Infinity Stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_Stones) üíé as an abstraction of multiple aspects in life. I will build my resolution based on this concept. There are many target I haven't reached last year, so this year I would like to be humble and finish what I started, plus some new challenges.
