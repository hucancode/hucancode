First of all, happy new year to all who celebrate, wish you happiness and prosperity in the year ahead. I hope the luck be with you and your family. May God of The Dragon üê≤ gives you strength to overcome all the hardships that might cross your path.

## Last Year's Achievement

Before go to the goal for this year, I would like to mention some nice thing happed last year. I have done some good job and I would like to praise myself for it.

### Reading

I have read 12 books this year. Taking out boring technical books, there are 9 about psychology, dating, self-help, business. Thinking in Bets, Atomic Habits, How to Not Die Alone is some that worth mentioning. I have broaden my knowledge and I like me that way.

### Programming

Last year I picked up `rust ü¶Ä` and like it very much. I can say that was a successful attempt or a nice adventure I would say. On a side note, `kotlin` is also on my list but I haven't done anything significant.

### Blog & Internet Presence

I have managed to maintain a blog, mostly low-effort leetcode solution but it's an active blog nonetheless. I have also did some creative coding and get something interesting out of it.

### Nhi üíñ

The relationship with Nhi is, without a doubt the best thing happened last year. After not a few moments of awkard silent, countless silly conversations and a clumsy confession, I did it. We are officially together, since 15<super>th</super> July 2023. We have walked through temples in Kyoto together. I have seen panda in real life for the first time, and her too probably. Speaking of panda, we have seen panda in most places we can find them in Japan. It's crazy how an introvert who never go outside like me now enjoy wandering Tokyo's street. Our personalities may seems contrast but turned out that's what makes us compatible. Fights make us understand each other more. I still learning to love her until today and I enjoy that process.

### 10K steps

I have been maintaining 10K steps nearly everyday since earlier this year. I even installed Strava and kept running for a month. Not so impressive but still an achievement.

## New Year's Resolution üéâ

### Methodology

Continue the tradition I have established last year. I will use [the Infinity Stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_Stones) üíé as an abstraction of multiple aspects in life. I will build my resolution based on this concept. There are many target I haven't reached last year, so this year I would like to be humble and finish what I started, plus some new challenges.
