First of all, happy new year to all who celebrate, wish you happiness and prosperity in the year ahead. May the luck be with you and your family. May the god of the rabbit üê∞ gives you strength to overcome all the hardship might cross your path.
Not sure how long it may last but I will start writing personal journal and self reflection, from this year. 
Hopefully it would be a good read when I look back later.

## Last Year's Achievement
Before go to the goal for this year, I would like to mention my last year's achievement. 
For some people, this is trivia, but to me it's has special meaning. I have growth and I'm proud of it.

### Get Over A Nasty Break Up
She was my first love. I loved her, it was hurtful but I'm glad I got over it. 
It cost me 6 months to learn how stupid and immature I am. I was and I am embarassed, that was a pretty expensive lession haha üòÄ. 
Later that year I met some new friend, learned new thing and get my life together (I guess).
I am now more grateful with what I am having. I feel pretty good now. 
Good friends are hard to come by, if you have one, treat them well, cherish them, invite them for a drink, buy them gift on their birthday!

### Learned Linux and Vim
I learned the important lesson about how a tiny simple thing can improve my life greatly. 
If you haven't use `vim` I would highly recommend learning it. It's a command line tool, it's ugly, but powerful. 
Not everyone needs lightning fast text editting skill, but trust me it worth a try.

### (Re)Started Competitive Programming
On the 1st September 2022, I gave my first submission after a very lonnng break and restarted my competitive programming journey. 
Over a month later I participated in my first Leetcode contest and placed at top 22.46% (R1594). Not so bad üòÄ.
That small win boosted my confidence and I eventually regain my momentum in training. 
This is the most unexpected gain because I just started Leetcode out of boredom. 
The result surprise me so much. I'm happy I started. Though not much, it‚Äôs indeed a memorable journey. 
It cleared one of my insecurities, ‚ÄúCompetitive Programming‚Äù. 
From when I ever started doing algorithm stuffs, I have always hated myself for being bad at it. 
I blamed my university lecturers for not being able to coach me properly ü§¢ What a loser I was.

### Got A New Job
I quit my job as an engineering manager at a small company. 
Leave some good friends behind and start a new position as a team leader building some useful things with my favorite language `C++`. 
Not wonderful but not bad either, who am I to choose, right?. Plus I met some nice people here too. I guess I will be here for a while.

## New Year's Resolution üéâ
### Methodology
I will refer to [the Infinity Stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_Stones) üíé as an abstraction of multiple aspects in life. This year, I would like to improve my:
- ‚ö° __Power__, specifically stamina, core strength, hip strength, leg strength
- üêæ __Space__, or improving my range of motion, flexibility, I want to achieve the full split this year
- üß† __Mind__, knowledge is power. I would like to train Leetcode, learn Taiji techniques (yes), read more about finance, maybe build a small side hustle
- üíñ __Soul__, build self-confidence, learn more about Tien (smartest girl I know). Learn to put effort into everything I do (I have a focus issue). Improve my story telling skill (Despite speaking 3 languages fluently I still have communication problems)
- ‚ú® __Reality__, prepare for the next career leap. Work on the game I always wanted to. Lean math
- ‚è∞ __Time__, get up early consistently. Seriously my daily schedule is messed up so bad
