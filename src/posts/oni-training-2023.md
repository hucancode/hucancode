First of all, happy new year to all who celebrate, wish you happiness and prosperity in the year ahead. I hope the luck be with you and your family. May God of The Rabbit 🐰 (or God of The Cat 🐱 if you are in Vietnam) gives you strength to overcome all the hardships might cross your path. Not sure how long it may last, but I will start writing journal and self reflection, from this year. Hopefully it would be a good read when I look back later.

## Last Year's Achievement

Before go to the goal for this year, I would like to mention my last year’s achievement. For some people, this is trivia, but to me, it has special meaning. I have grown and I’m proud of it.

### Get Over A Difficult Break Up

I loved her, it was hurtful. It cost me 6 months to learn how stupid and immature I am. I was, and I am embarrassed, that was a pretty expensive lesson haha 😀. Later that year I met some new friend, learned new thing and get my life together (I guess). I am grateful I still have some good friends, just a few, but good friends indeed. Good friends are hard to come by, if you have one, treat them well, cherish them, invite them for a drink, buy them a gift on their birthday!

### Learned Linux and Vim

I learned the important lesson about how a tiny, simple thing can improve my life greatly. If you haven’t used `vim` I would highly recommend learning it. It’s a command line tool, it’s ugly, but powerful. Not everyone needs lightning fast text editing skill, but trust me, it is worth a try.

### Competitive Programming

On the 1st September 2022, I gave my first submission after a very lonnng break and restarted my competitive programming training. Over a month later I participated in my first Leetcode contest and placed at top $22.46\%$ (didn't expect that high of a rank 😀). That small win boosted my confidence and I eventually regain my momentum in training. This is the most unexpected event because I just started Leetcode out of boredom. I am so happy I started. Though not much, it’s indeed a memorable journey.

### Got A New Job

New job, new opportunity, yay 🙌. I quit my job as an engineering manager at a small company. Leave some good friends behind and start a new position as a team leader, building some useful things with my favorite language `C++`. Plus, I met some nice people too. I guess I will be here for a while.

## New Year's Resolution 🎉

### Methodology

I will refer to [the Infinity Stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_Stones) 💎 as an abstraction of multiple aspects in life. Word on the street is that, to be as powerful as `Thanos`, one must find himself not 1, not 2, but 6 Infinity Stones. Since I am on my quest seeking the ultimate power, this year I want to improve my:

#### ⚡ Power Stone

In the Comic, power stone gives its owner, you know, power. In real life, improving "power" will allow me to have more energy, break my current limitation and improve my life quality.
Training Taiji is a good way to gain power. Specifically I will train:

- Core strength, hip strength, leg strength
- Stamina
- Flexibility

#### 🐾 Space Stone

Befitting its name, the Space Stone held dominion over the fabric of space being able to teleport its users anywhere in the universe. In real life, I mean the ability to take care of people I am caring for without the need of my presence. I will:

- Learn to put attention to detail
- Remember important days, birthday, memorial day
- Have a plan on how to express my affections. Otherwise I am no different than a stranger

#### 🧠 Mind Stone

Knowledge is power, knowledge is also money. I am good with the calculation and logical thinking. But there are still some domain remain foreign to me. I would like to explore those next year:

- Train Leetcode
- Learn about the body, live longer
- Finance, tax, FIRE

#### 💖 Soul Stone

My emotional skill deserves more work than it is receiving right now. Next year I would like to:

- Build self-confidence
- Learn more about Tien (smartest girl I know, also richest girl I know)
- Learn to put effort into everything I do (I have a focus issue)
- Improve my story telling skill (despite speaking 3 languages fluently I still have communication problems)

#### ✨ Reality Stone

Reality means fate in our culture. To go against the heaven and change my fate, I need to:

- Learn System Design
- If at all possible, I would like to work on the game I always wanted to,
- Lean math

#### ⏰ Time Stone

I am bad at time management. Mostly because the lacking of discipline 😎 and motivation 🙄. This year I need to:

- Get up early consistently
