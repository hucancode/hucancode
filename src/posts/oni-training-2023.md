First of all, happy new year to all who celebrate, wish you happiness and prosperity in the year ahead. I hope the luck be with you and your family. May God of The Rabbit 🐰 (or God of The Cat 🐱 if you are in Vietnam) gives you strength to overcome all the hardships might cross your path. Not sure how long it may last, but I will start writing journal and self reflection, from this year. Hopefully it would be a good read when I look back later.

## Last Year's Achievement
Before go to the goal for this year, I would like to mention my last year’s achievement. For some people, this is trivia, but to me, it has special meaning. I have grown and I’m proud of it.

### Get Over A Nasty Break Up
She was my first love. I loved her, it was hurtful, but I’m glad I got over it. It cost me 6 months to learn how stupid and immature I am. I was, and I am embarrassed, that was a pretty expensive lesson haha 😀. Later that year I met some new friend, learned new thing and get my life together (I guess). I am grateful I still have some good friends, just a few, but good friends indeed. Good friends are hard to come by, if you have one, treat them well, cherish them, invite them for a drink, buy them a gift on their birthday!

### Learned Linux and Vim
I learned the important lesson about how a tiny, simple thing can improve my life greatly. If you haven’t used `vim` I would highly recommend learning it. It’s a command line tool, it’s ugly, but powerful. Not everyone needs lightning fast text editing skill, but trust me, it is worth a try.

### Competitive Programming
On the 1st September 2022, I gave my first submission after a very lonnng break and restarted my competitive programming journey. Over a month later I participated in my first Leetcode contest and placed at top 22.46% (R1594). Not so bad 😀. That small win boosted my confidence and I eventually regain my momentum in training. This is the most unexpected gain because I just started Leetcode out of boredom. The result surprise me so much. I’m happy I started. Though not much, it’s indeed a memorable journey. It cleared one of my insecurities, “Competitive Programming”. From when I ever started doing algorithm stuffs, I have always hated myself for being bad at it. I blamed my university lecturers for not being able to coach me properly 🤢 What a loser I was.

### Got A New Job
New job, new opportunity, yay 🙌. I quit my job as an engineering manager at a small company. Leave some good friends behind and start a new position as a team leader, building some useful things with my favorite language `C++`. Plus, I met some nice people too. I guess I will be here for a while.


## New Year's Resolution 🎉
### Methodology
I will refer to [the Infinity Stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_Stones) 💎 as an abstraction of multiple aspects in life. Word on the street is that, to be as powerful as `Thanos`, one must find himself not 1, not 2, but 6 Infinity Stones. Since I'm on my quest seeking the ultimate power, this year I want to improve my:
#### ⚡ Power
- Core strength, hip strength
- Leg strength
- Organ health are correlate with longevity
- Lower body strength are correlate with life quality
- Training Taiji benefits both inner organ and lower body health
#### 🐾 Space
- Stamina, stamina is like battery, small battery capacity is very annoying
- Flexibility, I want to achieve the full split this year
#### 🧠 Mind
- Train Leetcode
- Learn Taiji techniques, learn about the body, live longer
- Knowledge is power, knowledge is also money. Read books to be more finacial literate
#### 💖 Soul
- Build self-confidence
- Learn more about Tien (smartest girl I know, also richest girl I know)
- Learn to put effort into everything I do (I have a focus issue)
- Improve my story telling skill (despite speaking 3 languages fluently I still have communication problems)
#### ✨ Reality
- Prepare for the next career leap, as if I can lost my job anytime
- Work on the game I always wanted to
- Lean math, yes, math
#### ⏰ Time
- Get up early consistently
- Seriously, my daily schedule is messed up so bad
