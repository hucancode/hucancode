First of all, happy new year to everyone that celebrate, wish you happiness and prosperity. Not sure how long it may last but I will start writing personal journal and self reflection, from this year. Hopefully it would be a good read when I look back later.

## Methodology
I will refer to [the Infinity Stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_Stones) as an abstraction of multiple aspects in life. This year, I would like to improve my:
- __Power__, specifically stamina, core strength, hip strength, leg strength
- __Space__, or improving my range of motion, flexibility, I want to achieve the full split this year
- __Mind__, knowledge is power. I would like to train Leetcode, learn Taiji techniques (yes), read more about finance, maybe build a small side hustle
- __Soul__, learn more about Tien (smartest girl I know). Learn to put effort into everything I do (I have a focus issue). Improve my story telling skill (Despite speaking 3 languages fluently I still have communication problems). Build confidence
- __Reality__, prepare for the next career leap. Work on the game I always wanted to. Lean math, graphics programming
- __Time__, get up early consistently. Seriously my daily schedule is messed up so bad

## Last Year's Achievement
Before go to the goal for this year, I would like to mention my last year's achievement. For some people, this is trivia, but to me it's has special meaning. I have growth and I'm prowd of it.

### Get Over A Nasty Break Up
She was my first love. I loved her, it was hurtful but I'm glad I got over it. It cost me 6 months to learn how childish I am. Pretty expensive lession. Later last year I met some new friend, learned new thing and get my life together.
I am now more grateful with what I am having. Feel pretty good now.

### Learned Linux and Vim
I learned the important lesson about how a tiny simple thing can improve my tech life greatly. If you haven't use `vim` I would highly recommend learning it.

## 2023's Goals
