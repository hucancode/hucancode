First of all, happy new year to all who celebrate, wish you happiness and prosperity in the year ahead. I hope the luck be with you and your family. May God of The Rabbit üê∞ (or God of The Cat üê± if you are in Vietnam) gives you strength to overcome all the hardships might cross your path. Not sure how long it may last, but I will start writing journal and self reflection, from this year. Hopefully it would be a good read when I look back later.

## Last Year's Achievement

Before go to the goal for this year, I would like to mention my last year‚Äôs achievements. For some people, this is trivial, but to me, it has a special meaning. I have grown and I‚Äôm proud of it.

### Break Up

At the beginning of the year, when holiday sprit is still in the air, my girlfriend broke up with me. What a great way to start a year! Lucky for me I still have some good friends during the hard times, just a few, but good friends indeed. Good friends are hard to come by, if you have any, treat them well, cherish them, invite them for a drink, buy them a gift on their birthday!

### Linux and Vim

I reached out and found my people. Installed `Arch` from scratch so I can safely says `I use Arch btw`. Learned a lot of new programming concepts last year thanks to Linux and Open Source community. I learned the important lesson about how a tiny, simple thing can improve my life greatly. If you have not used¬†`vim`¬†I would highly recommend learning it. It is a command line tool, it is ugly by default, but powerful.

### Competitive Programming

On the 1st September 2022, I gave my first submission after a very lonnng break and restarted my competitive programming training. Later I participated in my first Leetcode contest and placed at top $22.46\%$ (didn't expect that high of a rank üòÄ). That small win boosted my confidence and I eventually regain my momentum in training.

### New Job

New job, new opportunity, yay üôå. I quit my job as an engineering manager at a small company. Leave some good friends behind and start a new position as a team leader, building some useful things with my favorite language¬†`C++`. Plus, I met some nice people too. I guess I will be here for a while.

## New Year's Resolution üéâ

### Methodology

I will refer to [the Infinity Stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_Stones) üíé as an abstraction of multiple aspects in life. Word on the street is that, to be as powerful as `Thanos`, one must find himself not 1, not 2, but 6 Infinity Stones. Since I am on my quest seeking the ultimate power, this year I want to improve my:

#### ‚ö° Power Stone

Power (or strength) is one of the most primitive quality a person can have. Having abundant strength helps increase longevity and life quality. Training Taiji is a good way to address that problem. Specifically I will train:

- Core strength, hip strength, leg strength
- Stamina
- Flexibility

#### üêæ Space Stone

I would like to learn how to take care of people I love without being close to them geographically, which requires:

- Learn to put attention to detail
- Remember important days, birthday, memorial day
- Have a plan on how to express my affections. Otherwise I am no different than a stranger

#### üß† Mind Stone

Knowledge is power, knowledge is also money. I am pretty confident with the calculation and logical thinking. But there are still some domains remain foreign to me. I would like to explore those next year:

- Train Leetcode
- Learn about the body, live longer
- Finance, tax, FIRE
- Learn how the dating game works

#### üíñ Soul Stone

My emotional skill deserves more work than it is receiving right now. Next year I would like to:

- Build self-confidence
- Learn to put effort into everything I do
- Improve my story telling skill

#### ‚ú® Reality Stone

Reality means fate in our culture. It takes great effort to go against the heaven and change my fate. One can easily know that making such changes in 1 year is difficult. So this year I will narrow down my target to:

- Learn System Design
- If at all possible, I would like to work on the game I always wanted to
- If at all possible, learn to animate 3D characters
- If at all possible, lean math, geometry, combinatorics

#### ‚è∞ Time Stone

I do not have a sense of time management. This year I would like to:

- Learn to set time and scope of work to all tasks
- Get up early consistently
