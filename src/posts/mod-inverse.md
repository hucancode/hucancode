## Problem

Given a formular which result is normally very large, canâ€™t be stored in any primitive data type. Calculate the result in mod $1e9+7$. The formular often involve _division_. 
For example, let's calculate this

$$
nCr \equiv \frac{n!}{(n-r)!r!} \pmod {1e9+7}
$$

## Naive approach

### Naive approach 1 (Heavy Implementation)

1. Calculate $n!$, using big number class to store result
2. Calculate $(n-r)!r!$, also using a custom implemented `BigNumber` class
   1. You can optimize this by calculate $n!/r!$ in one loop. This way you decimate alot of computation
3. Divide 2 numbers to get the result
4. Mod the result by $1e9+7$

This requires **non-trivial** effort to implement `BigNumber` class. 
`Python` folks are in luck but most programming language doesn't support big number by default.
Assume that you are an average programmer like me. You often fail to come up with a correct implementation of the `BigNumber` class.

### Naive approach 2 (Wrong Answer)

1. Calculate $n! \pmod {1e9+7}$
2. Calculate $(n-r)!r! \pmod {1e9+7}$
   1. Same as before. You can optimize this by calculate $n!/r!$ in one loop. This way you decimate alot of computation
3. Divide 2 numbers to get the result

This gives WA because the algorithm is wrong mathematically.

## Solution

The problem with naive approach #2 is that, in step 3 where we normally divide 2 numbers, we get incorrect answer.
Because _division_ doesnâ€™t work in modular arithmetic, only _multiplication_.
But luckily there is a formular to address this issue,
it converts division to multiplication by leveraging [Modular multiplicative inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse).

Formally, **if $k$ is a prime number**, we have

$$
a \div b \equiv a \times b^{-1} \pmod k\\
b^{-1} \equiv b^{k-2} \pmod k\\
a \div b \equiv a \times b^{k-2} \pmod k
$$

Everytime you were to do _division_, you multiply it with the power $k-2$ of the divisor instead and itâ€™s guaranteed correct mathematically ðŸ˜Ž

There is a new problem araise, calculation of $b^{k-2}$ could be expensive (for example $k=1e9+7$). This could easily be solved by using a fast $O(logn)$ power calculation algorithm

```cpp
#define INF (1e9+7)
long long fastPow(int x, int p) {
	if(p == 0) return 1;
	if(p == 1) return x;
	auto k = fastPow(x,p/2);
	return k*k*fastPow(x,p%2)%INF;
}
```
